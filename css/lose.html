<img src="protein.jpeg" alt="image not found">
<h2 style="font-size: 30px;" class="head2">1.Eat a High Protein Meal</h2>
<br>
<labal class="para">
Eating higher amounts of protein will help 
suppress your hunger and appetite for hours
 after your meals. Protein increases the 
production of hormones like PYY and GLP-1,
 both of which help you feel full and satisfied. 
In addition, it helps reduce levels of ghrelin, also known as the 
“hunger hormone”. Eating a breakfast which is 
high in protein has been shown to reduce
 hourly cravings and lower your calorie intake 
throughout the day.

<br>
<h2 class="head2" >2.Avoid Sugary Drinks And Fruit Juice</h2>
<br>
<label class="para">
While there is generally a positive view 
about 100% fruit juices, there are some public 
health bodies that have raised concerns about
 their potential impact on body weight, 
particularly with respect overconsumption 
and sugar content. On average, drinks provide
 1,609 kJ (385 kcal), approximately 30% of which
 comes from sugar-sweetened beverages, 
21% of which comes from sugar-sweetened 
milk, and 18% of which comes from fruit juices. 
Sugary drinks provide empty calories. 
Simple sugars such as table sugar and 
high-fructose corn syrup do not have any 
nutritional value. A tablespoon of sugar provides 
45 empty calories. When you are drinking 
sugary drinks instead of water you are loading
 your body with extra sugars and calories. 
A can of soda has about 142 calories.
 If you drink 3.5 cans of sodas per day, you
 will gain a pound a week. That’s 4 pounds per month and 48 pounds per year. Drink water, skim milk, or sugar-free drinks. A healthy alternative could be a protein 
shake made from plant-based protein powder that can fuel your body with necessary nutrients and protein.

<h2 class="head2" >3.Drink Water a Half An Hour Before Meals:</h2>
<label class="para">
A study showed that drinking some water a half an hour before meals increased weight loss by 45% over the course of 3 months. For the longest time, drinking water has been thought to help with the loss of weight in adults. In fact, 30–59% of adults who try to lose weight increase their water intake. Many studies show that drinking more water may benefit weight loss and maintenance A study of overweight women examined the effects of increasing water intake to over 1 litre per day. They found that over a yearly period, this resulted in an extra 2 kg of weight loss.

<h2 class="head2" >4.Choose Weight Lose Friendly Foods:</h2>
<br>
<labal class="para">
	Research by scientists has revealed that some foods may have an impact on appetite. These could be beneficial for weight loss when incorporated into a healthful diet and lifestyle. People should buy nutrient-dense foods if they are trying to lose weight. One study found that some real foods — including fruits, vegetables, nuts, whole grains, and yoghurt — were connected with helping you lose weight. In the same study, potato chips, sugary beverages, red meats, and processed meats were associated with weight gain. Based on these findings, it may be best to limit fried foods, foods with added sugar, high-fat meats, and processed foods when trying to shed the kilos.

<h2 class="head2">5.Drink Coffee Or Tea:</h2>
<label class="para">
When you are trying to lose weight, unsweetened tea and coffee can be the best choice for you! Tea and coffee contain very calories, which can help in boosting your metabolism and improve your body’s overall ability to burn fats. On the other hand, coffee can make you feel full and increase the speed of your metabolism thus it helps in weight loss. If you are a working person or have to work hard in the gym, coffee can be a good choice for you for losing weight because it has more caffeine than tea.

<br>
<h2 class="head2">6.Eat Your Food Slowly</h2>
<label class="para">People who eat quickly tend to weigh more than those who don’t. In fact, quick eaters are up to 116% more likely than people who chew slowly to be obese. They also tend to increase their weight over time, which may be partially due to chewing and eating very fast. In one study in over 4,000 middle-aged adults, those who said they ate very fast tended to be heavier and had gained the most bodyweight. After a meal, your gut suppresses a hormone called ghrelin, which controls hunger, while also releasing fullness hormones. These hormones tell your brain that you have eaten, reducing appetite, making you feel full, and helping you stop eating. This process takes about 20 minutes, so slowing down gives your brain the time it needs to receive these signals.</label>
